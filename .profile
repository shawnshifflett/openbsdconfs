# Hello there and welcome to your .profile!  The .profile is a

# I'd like to help you with a few notes about each part. 
#
# This sets the environment variable "MAIL" for the location of your
# email file.  Typically email is spooled in /usr/mail with the user's
# login (enviroment variable LOGNAME) for the file's name.
MAIL=/mail/${LOGNAME:?}
#MAIL=mbox

# Which editor?  Well, here is the standard and then the VIsual editor
# based off of ex (EXtended ed).  But since you might not know these,

EDITOR=/usr/pkg/bin/vim

# Neat hacks for the David Korn's shell.
# standard prompt is the dollar sign.  The shell comment character
# if you can't tell is the pound (#) sign.  Uncomment out the follow
# and delete the line after it (or comment it out) if you would like
# the standard UNIX Korn shell prompt.

# This tells the system what terminal you are using or emulating.  We do
# support a number of terminals and can infact support more.  For more 
# ideas, you can look in /usr/lib/terminfo.  Default TTY is typically a
# DEC vt100.
TERM=xterm-color

# stty (Set TTY) sets up your TTY.  Note, if you have problems with
# your backspace key, try changing the "erase '^h'" to "erase '^?'".
# If that still does not help, type stty erase at the shell prompt
#and then hit your backspace key.

stty erase '^h' echoe

# The following can be used for setting up the number of lines and 
# columns you are using.  Most typical PC-COMM programs use 24 lines

#LINES=25
#COLUMNS=80
